# Wireless-Network-Using-NS2

The following steps have been taken in this project:

* Defining the topology on which the simulation is performed in the NS2 environment and using the TCL language
* Running the emulator and generate output files
* Analyzing and parsing the output files using Python and obtaining the following values:
  * Throughput
  * Packet Transfer Ratio
  * Average End-to-End Delay
* Drawing different plots based on the parsed file
